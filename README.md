Conways Game of Life

Recreating this Cellular Automata in a TypeScript web application. First leare about this in my software development course where I created this in c# using wpf. Translating this to javascript -> typescript from scratch. Also using tailwind for styling.


Part 1: Building out the skeleton and function
In this part I decided to start with 3 generic sizes (10,15,20). In the future I plan on adding a customizable option for more variance.

Built out functions for creating the board. The biggest challenge is translating Js to Ts as this is my first time progaming in typescript. Nonetheless progress has been made and moving on to the next part.
